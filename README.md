# JungleEscape

Vivien: We spent most of class talking in general about how to code for different parts of the games. I added a createbackground() to TerminalDemo to form the grid for 2048.

Vivien: I restarted from scratch, realizing that I didn't need to include any of the terminal aspects in the NumberPuzzle class. Partway in, after I had already made a few commits, I realized I named the NumberPuzzle class incorrectly, so I removed the old numberPuzzle and created a new file, copying the code from the other one. I finished writing constructor, toString(), all the move methods and isComplete(). Next, I need to start working on JungleEscape to incorporate the terminal and keystrokes.
